# Minesweeper
![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a9e4013-1752-4694-8aca-de59aa219542)

A simple minesweeper game witten in java.

The program uses ANSI and JLine to represent different colors, monitor input and render the game field.

Due to my poor optimization, the program will be extremely slow when processing large game fields.😭
